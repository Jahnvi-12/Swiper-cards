# Swiper-cards

Each card contains a question, options and a submit button. The question set present in each module is related to that module and in the end there is button to view score which has the total number of correct answers from the overall questions in quiz. The quiz is designed in swiper card format where you can either click on the arrows present on the page to nagivagate to next/previous questions or you can drag the swiper card to change the questions. Here, in phishing we have used swipe effect, cube effect for credit card, flip effect for social media and cards effect in password security.
Once you press the button a popup is displayed which tells whether the selected option is correct or incorrect along with a short suggestion for reference.
